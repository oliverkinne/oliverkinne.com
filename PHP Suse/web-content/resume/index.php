			<h3>My Resume</h3>

			<aside>
				<h4>PLASA</h4>
				<p class="dates">July 1999 – Present (14 years 3 months)</p>
				<p class="team">Website Developer</p>
				<p>In my current role, I manage a member of staff to fulfill all internal design and print production requirements, and two IT support companies to maintain and look after our internal IT infrastructure.</p>
				<p>I control a budget of over &pound;150,000 and deal with all software, web and other developments. I oversee the IT infrastructure of three offices in two time zones, looking after over 50 staff and freelancers, including software, hardware, networking, site-to-site connections, operating systems, cloud services, etc.</p>
				<p>Over the years I completely overhauled the company's single website and extended it into five sites, creating a new advertising revenue stream of over &pound;20,000 annually.</p>
				<p>I programmed the sites in JScript (ASP) and PHP, and designed them to be device agnostic and search engine optimized. I implemented load performance improvements, such as lazy image loading and late script loading. I developed a number of different caching techniques to reduce the load on the server and recently implemented CDN on some sites to increase performance even further. I used JQuery for cross-platform compatibility and rapid development, and applied strict CSS and HTML separation for easy site maintenance.</p>
				<p>I also designed and implemented a number of SQL databases, as well as some internal MS Access databases and other simple systems to allow non-technical staff to update our websites and make staff more efficient and productive.</p>
				<p>I regularly use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, Acrobat, as well as Microsoft Access, Excel, Word and Outlook. I have migrated the company's Exchange infrastructure to Office 365 and set up Amazon EC2 for additional, shared data storage. I use GitHub for code maintenance and a combination of Confluence, Gliffy, Excel and Access to document our systems.</p>
