				<h4>Clans of Macaria</h4>
				<p class="dates"><?php print_date_range('1 October 2013', null) ?></p>
				<p class="team"></p>
				<p>Clans of Macaria is an on-line, turn-based game for multiple players. The game system uses elements from many popular board games, but as a whole is completely original.</p>
				<p>It is still in development and is programmed in PHP, using a MySQL database to store the game states and related data. The site uses JQuery, CSS and HTML.</p>
				<p>It is an illustration of my development knowledge and experience and shows that I am self-motivated and can learn new skills quickly and independantly.</p>
				<p>Like 'My Resume Website', this website is hosted on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 running Apache 2.2, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.3 and Ruby 1.8.7 on Amazon's Web Services, and it uses performance improving and search engine optimisation techniques, as well as CDN.</p>

				<h4>My Resume Website</h4>
				<p class="dates"><?php print_date_range('1 September 2013', null) ?></p>
				<p class="team"></p>
				<p>The oliverkine.com website was built in PHP, with SEO and pageload performance in mind. CloudFlare CDN was applied to make the site even more efficient and load even more quickly.</p>
				<p>CSS is used on the homepage to create rollover effects, as well as for styling.</p>
				<p>The opening of external links in a new window/tab is achieved via JQuery.</p>
				<p>The site is hosted on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 running Apache 2.2, MySQL 5.5, PHP 5.3 and Ruby 1.8.7 on Amazon's Web Services.</p>
				<p>It is an illustration of the web development skills and experience I have and shows that I can work on a project independantly, am self-motivated and can quickly learn new skills on the job.</p>

				<h4>LSi Online Website Rebuild</h4>
				<p class="dates"><?php print_date_range('1 June 2012', '30 April 2013') ?></p>
				<p class="team">Team Members: <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/alex-dato/60/267/835/">Alex Dato</a>, <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/lee-baldock/1/b94/5a0/">Lee Baldock</a></p>
				<p>The LSi Online website was rebuilt to make it device agnostic, allowing it to display equally well on desktop and laptop computers, as well as tablets and smartphones. The site was also built to load quickly, using &quot;lazyload&quot; for images, CSS sprites, late loading of JavaScript, caching of searches and other database driven information on the server and pre-building of database driven information where possible.</p>
				<p>The site also employs SEO techniques, uses metadata for page classification and content tagging (OpenGraph) and is built with visually impaired users in mind as well.</p>
				<p>Alex Dato was responsible for the design of the site, while Lee Baldock oversaw the project to make sure it met the Media team's requirements, and he tested the site as well. I built the site in ASP (JScript) using Dreamweaver.</p>

				<h4>Online Manuals System</h4>
				<p class="dates"><?php print_date_range('1 January 2012', null) ?></p>
				<p class="team"></p>
				<p>I developed an online manuals system for exhibitions and events. The system allows exhibitors to submit their orders to exhibition contractors, as well as complete regulatory and other required documentation to help the event management process.</p>
				<p>The system is highly customizable to allow seamless integration with an exhibition's branding and design. It can cope with virtually any type, quantity and complexity of forms, including multi-step forms, required fields, fields that become required based on other selections, enforcement of field types (date, number, etc.), secure fields (credit card details, etc.) and file uploads (attachments, etc.).</p>
				<p>The system can email form submission confirmations to the exhibitor, as well as to the contractor and allows the exhibitor and contractor to keep track of which forms have been submitted, which ones are outstanding and when they need to be completed by.</p>
				<p>Contractors can download the submitted information either as a CSV or XML file, or view the information on screen or print it out. The system also keeps track of what information a contractor has already downloaded, to allow only new submissions to be downloaded, as well as the full set, if required.</p>

				<h4>PLASA Lib - JQuery and JScript</h4>
				<p class="dates"><?php print_date_range('1 January 2011', null) ?></p>
				<p class="team"></p>
				<p>I built a library of JScript and JQuery functionality for rapid website development. The library is not based on existing code, but was programmed from the ground up. It covers string functions, date and number formatting functions, character conversion functions for UTF-8 and other HTML character sets, as well as server- and client-side form validation routines.</p>

				<h4>Searchable Book Database OTree</h4>
				<p class="dates"><?php print_date_range('1 September 1998', '31 October 1998') ?></p>
				<p class="team"></p>
				<p>Development of bespoke, searchable books database on CD, which contained full information about tens of thousands of books, including title, author, description, ISBN, binding, pages, illustrations, etc. as well as a scanned cover image. I developed a new database system, called OTree, which was based on BTree, to create a highly compressed database of the books that would fit onto CD and would allow very fast searches and information retrieval.</p>
