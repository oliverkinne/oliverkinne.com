				<p>Throughout my career I have enjoyed helping my employer to improve efficiency, increase productivity and develop new business opportunities.</p>
				<p>As an experienced developer, I expanded my current employer's only and static website, into five dynamic, database-driven, search engine optimized and high performing sites, multiplying the opportunities of revenue for the business.</p>
				<p>Applying my networking knowledge I streamlined the IT infrastructure of originally one office and one server, and expanded it into three offices in two time zones, supporting around 50 staff, five servers and a virtual web server.</p>
				<p>I appointed and supervised external providers and implemented cloud based services to increase the efficiency and productivity of the company's teams.</p>
