			<h3>My Skills</h3>

			<aside>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>Management: I manage a small internal team as well as a number of external service providers and control a budget of over &pound;150,000. I have also successfully managed a large number of sizeable internal as well as external projects, liaising with external clients at every stage of the project lifecycle.</p>
				<p>Software Development: I have many years' experience of software development in a number of programming languages, including OOP. I also contribute to a number of public GitHub projects.</p>
				<p>Web Development: I have hands-on knowledge of HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, JScript, VBScript and PHP. I have applied device agnostic design and load performance improvements, such as lazy image and late script loading, and implemented a number of SEO techniques. I have developed several caching techniques to reduce page load time and improve server performance. I have also built a function library to help rapid web development.</p>
				<p>CMS/Wikis: I have developed a number of internal systems that allow staff update website content as necessary. I am currently in the process of migrating one of our websites to Joomla, to give staff even greater flexibility with updates and to introduce a proper workflow for content changes. I have also installed, configured and administered Confluence, the popular collaboration system and Wiki.</p>
				<p>HTML Emails: I have created many HTML emails from scratch, without the use of software tools or HTML email builders. The HTML emails are compatible with all common clients and are designed to increase the effectiveness of the marketing campaign.</p>
				<p>Cloud Services: I have migrated the company's in-house Exchange infrastructure to Microsoft Office 365, which involved moving about 50 mailboxes. I have also implemented Amazon Web Services' S3 to extend in-house storage and set up AWS EC2 to build a LAMP test server.</p>
				<p>Databases: I have many years' working knowledge of many database platforms, from MS Access to SQL Server and MySQL. I have designed and built a large number of databases from scratch, including defining indexes and keys for high throughput, fast searching, or a balance of both.</p>
				<p>Software Packages: I have hands-on knowledge of the whole Adobe Creative Suite, in particular Dreamweaver, Flash, Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as the Microsoft Office suite, such as Access, Excel and Word. I use GitHub to maintain a number of in-house projects and in my spare time contribute to public projects.</p>
