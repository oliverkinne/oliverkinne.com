				<p>Web Development: I have hands-on knowledge of HTML, CSS, ASP and PHP, device agnostic design and load performance improvements, such as lazy image and late script loading. I implemented a number of SEO techniques and developed a several caching techniques to reduce page load time. I also built a library of functionality for rapid development.</p>
