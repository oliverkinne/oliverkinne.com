    'article' => '<p>Windows PCs have had trouble with viruses, trojans, worms and many other malware for decades - simply because they\'re the biggest target.</p>
<p>Apple (and also *nix) users have always thought their systems were safe because they were running MacOS (in those days) or more recently OS X. Apple\'s operating system is a little more secure than Windows, due to its structure, but Microsoft is making great strides in making Windows less vulnerable and more secure from the ground up.</p>
<p>The only difference between Apple (and Linux derivatives) and Windows is that one is a bigger target than the other - and thus there are more people trying to hack it and find weaknesses. Apple has never said that their computers were virus free - and in fact malware on Apple computer is as old as the computers themselves.</p>
<p>The Elk Cloner virus was written back in 1981 by a 15 year old, and it was capable of infecting the boot sector of Apple II computers. A fair amount of malware was developed for Apple computers since then, and each new iteration became more and more aggressive. In 2011, it was discovered that the Flashback Trojan&nbsp;was exploiting a Mac OS X security flaw in Java, and by 2012 it had infected roughly 600,000 Macs, creating a global botnet.</p>
<p>So, even though there is still less malware attacking Apple computers, when compared to Windows PCs, it doesn\'t preclude Apple computers from becoming infected. In fact, if an Apple computer does become infected, people are less likely to notice as they will simply assume that their computer is safe. Apple users don\'t usually run malware scans on their machines, so any infection can easily survive unnoticed for a very long time and execute its malicious code in the background.</p>
<p>Also, as Apple\'s market share grows, there is a good chance that malware attacks will increase as well. So, if you are an Apple user, you should definitely have malware protection. Better to be prepared than get a nasty surprise later.</p>

    'article' => '<p>Being an escapist isn\'t a bad thing. Wanting things to be different can give you the energy to make your life better or find better solutions to problems. Use your desire to get away from the daily chores in your favour.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how being an escapist can give you the tools to perform better and find better results.</p>
<h3>Daydreaming</h3>
<p>Escapists are usually known for daydreaming, so if you daydream a lot, you\'re probably an escapist. You want to create your own reality and you do this quite naturally, as part of your daily routine. Daydreams tend to show you your deepest wants and desires, so embrace them. It could help you think yourself out of a problem.</p>
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<p>If you can daydream, you are usually very creative - and escapists tend to be very creative people. If you are very creative, you can come up with new ideas all the time. Use this to your advantage by coming up with some great new ways of solving your problems.</p>
<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>Escapists usually want to shape their lives they way they want to - not how they think others expect them to. If you\'re an escapist you will probably yearn for freedom all the time. Try and use that energy to change the things that aren\'t right and work towards the freedom you crave.</p>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>Travel and freedom are very closely linked. If you\'re an escapist, you probably love travelling. You want to explore the world and gain new experiences all the time. It will make you feel free and independent, allowing you to get away from daily chores. You can use your experiences to further yourself and learn new skills.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>Escapists rarely read non-fiction - it\'s mostly fantasy and sci-fi, where you can get away from this world and enter a completely new and different world. You love imagining how life could be different. At the same time you can use that imagination to envisage how your current life could be shaped differently or how things can be made better.</p>
<h3>Procrastination</h3>
<p>As an escapist it is often easier not to face the here and now and instead flee into another world. That leads to delaying tactics and finding excuses why something cannot be done now and has to wait until later. Try and change that attitude into something positive. Instead of trying to get away, make a decision and find solutions to actually get away from what you don\'t like and to reach where you want to be.</p>
<h3>Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Nobody likes uncertainty, but escapist especially avoid it. It is easier to find an alternate reality. So to improve things for yourself, remove uncertainty. Ask questions or learn about the situations you are likely to face. The more you understand what you are up against, the more certain things will seem and the more confident you will be.</p>
<p>So use the energy of escapism in your favour. You are a creative person - use that creativity to make things better.</p>',

    'article' => '<p>Blogs are a way of keeping your current, as well as potential, customers up-to-date. It is a way of getting people to visit your website regularly. Returning visitors are more likely to buy from you. So even though it\'s tough to commit to regular updates, you will soon see the benefit.</p>
<p>Here are some ways in which a blog helps you get leads.</p>
<h3>1. Offering advice</h3>
<p>Potential customers buy from you because they have a problem and because your products or services solve the problem. Potential customer are unlikely to come to you because they know your products and services already.</p>
<p>If someone has a wedding, they look for florists, bakeries, venues, etc. If you can write a blog that gives tips and advice on how to have a successful, amazing, cost-effective or otherwise great wedding, people who are planning a wedding will use it to help them.</p>
<p>Add links to relevant products and services on your website to each blog post, so people can immediately buy what they need, so that your blog becomes a help guide, which cleverly steers potential customers to your products and services.</p>
<p>Also, the more your relevant your website is to a topic, the higher it will be listed on search engines. Your blog will become a great resource for people to find help with whatever it is they are struggling with.</p>
<h3>2. Show off your expertise</h3>
<p>If you can use your blog to show off your expertise, potential customers will start to build trust in you. It may seem scary, but if your business is good at what it offers, then blog about it. It\'s a bit like posting customer quotes to show potential customers how your business has successfully helped others in the past.</p>
<p>However, rather than quote happy customers and talk about previous projects, you would blog about how you and your business can help potential customers with current issues, changes in regulation, new technology or the latest fashion.</p>
<p>By all means also speak about your previous successes, but it is often more powerful if you can show that your business is up-to-date and has its fingers on the pulse.</p>
<h3>3. Reach a new audience</h3>
<p>Your blog doesn\'t have to be integrated into your website. It may be even better to use platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook to post updates. That way you reach a wider audience. If people don\'t already visit your website, they won\'t see your blog - but people are on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, so if they can see your posts, you can draw them to your website.</p>
<p>Of course, what platform you choose depends on the type of your business.</p>

    'link2' => '2015/08/seo-for-content-marketing',
    'article' => '<p>It used to be true that getting your website rank high on search engines had little to do with the content of your website. It was more about keyword tags, meta descriptions, back links and so on.</p>
<p>However, nowadays content is king when it comes to reaching the top of search results. Marketing your website without having content that complements the effort is futile.</p>
<p>Here are some quick tips to help you get your website ranked higher:</p>
<h3>Make keywords a natural part of the content</h3>
<p>Keywords used to be in meta tags, clearly separated from the page content itself. Even though meta keywords are still important, it is now most important to use relevant words in your page title and body of the page. Don\'t let them stick out, as if they were an afterthought, but integrate them naturally into the content.</p>
<h3>Keep on-page SEO</h3>
<p>Meta tags, both for keywords and description, title tags. image tags with alt options and H1 and H2 tags are still important, so don\'t forget about them. So continue to think about how best to use them so that potential customers can find your website.</p>
<h3>Put yourself in your potential customer\'s shoes</h3>
<p>Always remember that people who don\'t know your business may think about it differently. They may use different words in their searches to find you. So think out of the box. Unless your products are so well known that people will search for them directly, you may be better off catering your content for words that relate to your products. So if you\'re Coca-Cola, make sure you use "Coca-Cola" in your content, but otherwise maybe using terms such as "fizzy drinks", "pop" or such like is better.</p>
<h3>SEO is not just about product listings</h3>
<p>Listing all your business\'s products and services is important, but people are more likely to find your website if you write about how these products and services help them. If you sell paint, maybe write a few pages about choosing the right paint, what colours go best with other colours, how to easily clean your paint brushes and so on. Potential customers are more likely to visit your site more often.</p>
<h3>Social media is your friend</h3>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Google+, LinkedIn and even YouTube are only a few of the services out there. Depending on your business you have to decide which of these are right for you - but do use them. If customers recommend you to their friends or colleagues, you get free marketing - and people do tend to prefer when a business was recommended to them. So add Tweet, Like and other share buttons to every page of your website. It\'s really easy to do these days, so there is no reason not to.</p>
<h3>Pictures, because we\'re visual</h3>
<p>Many people are visual. Watching videos and looking through image galleries is something we all enjoy. Impactful pictures on your website are also very powerful ways of drawing people\'s eyes to important parts of your content. Don\'t forget to add an alt tag to every image though - and also don\'t use images instead of words. Textual content is still very important and search engines still don\'t use images to decide how to rank a website in their search results.</p>

    'article' => '<p>Perfection seems to be the ultimate goal for everyone. There should never be any hiccups and everything should run smoothly. We feel comfortable if everything is just so.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it is actually better if things don\'t go to plan. It can be good to feel a little frustration. It can motivate you to find a solution and make things better - rather than rest on your laurels and stick with the status quo.</p>
<p>Of course, frustration can also turn into stress, which is a negative thing. If something goes wrong and there is no solution and no way around the problem, then stress kicks in - especially if a deadline is looming as well.</p>
<p>So here are the steps to take when faced with a problem - and how to turn your frustration into a positive.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge the problem</h3>
<p>Recognize what the problem is. See where the gap is between what you want and what you have.</p>
<h3>Understand the problem</h3>
<p>What exactly is the problem about? If you\'re frustrated with something, relax and think about what can be done to remove the problem. What do you know about the problem? What don\'t you know? Who else is might be able to help with the problem? What impact does the problem have?  Is it really as important as you think?</p>
<h3>Understand what you want</h3>
<p>What do you really want to achieve?  What would happen if nothing was done about the problem? What are your expectations? What is the best outcome and what is the minimum you require?</p>
<h3>Take the next step</h3>
<p>Now form a plan of action. You have all the facts. You know how important the problem is. Make it better.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help you turn a problem into an opportunity and move your business forward.</p>

    'link2' => '2015/07/fatal-mistake-when-writing-content',
    'article' => '<p>Writing content for a website or your social media isn\'t easy - but too often we fall into the trap of speaking the language the business understands - not the language that customers understand. There are cases where clients speak the same language as the business, but more often than not, they don\'t - so your message will get lost.</p>
<p>Mostly the difference comes from the point of view. As a business you want to sell widget A or service B - but your customers want to solve problem C. So when writing content, think about what problems your customers are facing and how your products or services can solve them - and then, near the end, tell them what that product or service is called, with a clear, easy to use "find out more" link - and maybe even a "buy now" button.</p>
<p>It can be very hard to get yourself into the shoes of your customers, but once you do see things from their point of view, you can really engage them.</p>
<p>I want to have a clean oven - so I don\'t know if I need the "Super Cleaner Spray", the "Wonder Wipe" or the "Grease Remover Foam". However, if you tell me that you can help me clean my oven and make it look sparkly and brand new, then I\'ll be interested. If you then tell me that you can send round someone to take away the hard work, dangerous chemicals and fumes and hard work involved in cleaning my oven by sending round one of your friendly and efficient team, then I know what I need. Give me a "buy now" button and I\'m sold.</p>
<p>So it\'s not about the solution - it\'s about the problem. I didn\'t need any of the cleaner products - I actually needed someone to clean the oven for me.</p>

    'link2' => '2015/07/marketing-mistakes-that-render-message',
    'article' => '<p>It is always easy to spot mistake other businesses make in their marketing - be it website or email addresses that aren\'t actually linked, missing phone numbers or even address details, and such like.</p>
<p>However, it is a lot harder to spot those types of mistakes in your own materials.</p>
<p>So here is a quick checklist of the sort of things you should be looking out for on your website, email or even print marketing.</p>
<h3>Call to action</h3>
<p>Everything you send out should have a short section that asks the recipient to do something. It covers the usual "contact us" details, but also things like "book your table now", "buy the item now" which direct people to the relevant page on your website or to a phone number.</p>
<p>Don\'t forget requests to interact with you, such as "like us" or "see us at the local exhibition".</p>
<p>There can be several calls to action, depending on what you\'re sending out, but every item must have at least one call to action. Without it the marketing material becomes ineffective. People might really like what you do, but most people need the extra nudge to get them to act.</p>
<h3>Say what you do</h3>
<p>You may have a really good business name that spells out exactly what it is you do or offer. However, a lot of companies need to explain what the business is about.</p>
<p>It may be absolutely clear what you offer, but for people who haven\'t come across your company it is going to be very important that they understand what services or products you offer and how these benefit the customers.</p>
<p>Especially if you offer some relatively technical services, your clients may not know that what you offer applies to them. Try to think in their terms and provide examples of how your business can specifically help the customer.</p>
<h3>Know your customers</h3>
<p>Be absolutely certain you know who your customers are and what their expectations are. Every business wants to cater for every possible type of customer to increase revenue, but in reality every business is only applicable to a certain type of customer.</p>
<p>Try and understand what your potential customers want and what they think they need. Speak on their terms and use language they will understand. What you call something in your business may not be what your customers call it - especially in very technical areas.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what customers might want, run a survey. If you already have a customer base, contact them first and find out what they think you can improve. Also do your best to ask people who aren\'t your customers yet, but who you think could become customers.</p>
<h3>Focus on your customers</h3>
<p>Marketing materials will inevitably talk about your business and the things you do well. However, ultimately it is about telling the customer that you can help them and how. It should focus on them and not how brilliant you are.</p>
<p>If your business has won awards, then that is wonderful and something you should say, but it won\'t be the only reason why a customer chooses your business over someone else\'s.</p>
<p>As a customer you want to feel that the business understands your needs and offers the right service for you.</p>
<h3>People are people</h3>
<p>The personal touch is what distinguishes good businesses from excellent ones. Understanding your customers and their needs is vital to running a successful business, but if you can go the extra step and bring the "human" back into the "interaction", then your business will start to excel.</p>
<p>Personal interactions are memorable and as a customer you are more likely to return to a business where you felt you were treated as a person and not as an account.</p>
<p>Human interaction doesn\'t just benefit businesses who deal with consumers, but also companies in the B2B sector. After all, irrespective of what your business does or who it deals with, ultimately there are people involved.</p>
<p>If you can give your business a human face, you\'ve taken the first step to make your business more personal. Also think about creating videos about the business and its products or services, where you and your team show potential customers what you can offer. If you can persuade existing customers to add their positive feedback to those videos, then even better.</p>

    'link2' => '2015/07/five-rude-emails-you-send-every-day',
    'article' => '<p>It is so easy to be misunderstood on email - and even if you are the most likeable and well behaved person in the world, you can still come across offensive.</p>
<p>In an email there is no emotion, facial expression, tone of voice, gestures, postures or any other visual or audible clues to help people interpret what you mean.</p>
<p>Email is very efficient and convenient, allowing conversations to progress at the pace of each person as and when they have a moment to reply. However, without the conversational clues people pick up on during a conversation, there are many pitfalls that can easily lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Here are some of those pitfalls that you might want to look out for - and hopefully avoid.</p>
<h3>Carbon Copies and Reply to All</h3>
<p>Copying other people into an email that is really only meant for one recipient can be annoying - not only for the copied recipients who don\'t really want to "hear" what you have to say, as it\'s not relevant to them, but potentially also for the actual recipient, who may feel that you want to ridicule them in front of others.</p>
<p>On the flipside, if you receive an email from someone where a whole group of people is copied in, you don\'t need to reply to everyone just to say "thank you" or "understood". That sort of response should simply go back to the original sender - the others are unlikely to need to see your reply.</p>
<p>Only reply to everyone if you\'re adding to the conversation, asking additional questions or are presenting another point that the rest of the group needs to see so they can discuss it or so that they are made aware of the additional information.</p>
<h3>One Word Answers</h3>
<p>Some people write very long emails, but others take to the other extreme. Most people don\'t use one word answers when they are face to face with someone - or when they do, they usually come across as short and rude.</p>
<p>The same is true for emails. Keep it brief, if you want to make the email exchange efficient, but stick to whole sentences and try to match your length of reply to the original email. If someone has spent a long time putting together a detailed email, it would be very rude to reply with a simple "agreed".</p>
<p>If you don\'t have time to write a long answer, then at least say so in your reply. Most people with understand that you can\'t write a long reply if you\'re busy, but unless you tell them that you\'re busy, the recipient won\'t know.</p>
<h3>Everything is URGENT</h3>
<p>In today\'s work environment, and especially with electronic communication, everyone has come to expect an instant answer and an immediate solution to a problem. So to stand out from the rest, it\'s so tempting to title your emails "URGENT" or "ASAP".</p>
<p>However, as mentioned above, an email exchange is about allowing the recipient to reply as and when they have time. The expectation of an immediate response is misplaced.</p>
<p>If something is really so urgent and needs immediate attention, then pick up the phone or get up and go and see the person at their desk. That way you can assess how busy the other person is and if there are, more important (and "more urgent") issues to be dealt with, before your problem can be addressed.</p>
<p>If you send an email about an urgent issue and don\'t get a response, because the other person is busy, you only end up calling or seeing them anyway - so why waste the time to compose and send an email.</p>
<p>If the issue isn\'t actually urgent, then why pretend in your email that it is?</p>
<h3>Everyone Else is Wrong</h3>
<p>Criticising is always easy. Coming up with a better solution is much, much harder. Also, hindsight is a brilliant thing - so telling someone how they could have avoided a problem after the event is usually not very helpful. Chances are the other person already knows.</p>
<p>If you want to offer constructive criticism, you need to explain how something could have been differently to improve the outcome - rather than explain what someone shouldn\'t have done.</p>
<p>Also don\'t just offer your criticism - however well meant. It\'s usually best to wait to be asked before providing your thoughts.</p>
<h3>Straight to the Point</h3>
<p>Doing away with pleasantries can feel like a good way of not wasting the recipient\'s time, but many people prefer a quick "introduction" before getting to the point of the email. It doesn\'t have to turn into a long exchange about the recipient\'s life story, but a simple "how is it going?" will soften the email.</p>
<p>If you know you\'re asking for a big favour or are potentially putting the recipient under additional pressure with your request, then it\'s always best to lead in with that. If you acknowledge that you\'re asking the recipient to go the extra mile, you\'re more likely to be received well and the recipient doesn\'t think you unfeeling. We all would like to feel others around understand our constraints, so it\'s better to acknowledge them.</p>
<h3>Email Pitfalls Avoided</h3>
<p>Following the simple advice above should help you avoid the usual email pitfalls. Emails are a great tool, but they can make the conversation a lot more impersonal and dehumanize the recipient - so take an extra few seconds and think about who you\'re sending the email to.</p>

    'article' => '<p>Very often you are not remembered by your successes, but by your failures and how well you dealt with them. One failure that more often than not force a business to fold is not being able to recover from a disaster quickly or even at all.</p>
<p>Disaster in this context isn\'t necessarily of the natural kind. It is more often the failure of your technology and the subsequent loss of data, connectivity and general ability to do business. If you haven\'t planned for the worst, you will find it hard to bring your business back up and running.</p>
<p>Businesses give various reasons for not having a disaster recovery plan. Cost, both in time and actual financial terms, buy-in from management and/or staff, or the complexity of implementing and testing the plan.</p>
<p>However, cost is usually a secondary factor. If you can quantify how much you would lose in terms of potential business if the worst happened, you already have a figure you can incorporate in your plan and which gives you an idea of the sort of investment needed.</p>
<p>Complexity is a real concern, but like with so many things, starting with a high level overview and breaking everything down little by little will easily deal with the potential complexity that is involved.</p>
<p>Buy-in should easily be dealt with - after all, if the worst happens and you have assigned a figure to how much business could be lost, both management and staff will quickly see the risk to the business and their own livelihoods.</p>
<p>The last thing is testing of course. Once you have put together your recovery plan, it\'s time to test it. The testing can be difficult, depending on your scenario, but if you identify a time when your business would be least impacted, you should be able to simulate a real life disaster and then see if your plan can cope with it.</p>
<p>Of course, once the plan has been put together and successfully tested, it needs to be kept up-to-date and tested regularly. An out-of-date plan is no good to anyone - even though it is still better than no plan at all.</p>

    'article' => '<p>A couple of months ago Wordpress issued an update and "strongly encouraged" all of their customers to install it "immediately". As you can probably tell from the language used, the update addressed a serious flaw in the highly popular CMS (content management system).</p>
<p>Wordpress is used by nearly 50% of websites worldwide, so a single vulnerability found in Wordpress gives hackers the potential to quickly and easily attack a huge pool of websites.</p>
<p>The technical details of the vulnerabilities plugged by the Wordpress update are at best boring to non-technical people, at worst non-technical people running their own Wordpress sites will ignore or not even be aware when they need to apply updates to keep their websites safe.</p>
<p>It is always best to let experts deal with your website, but Wordpress has the reputation that anyone and everyone can use it - and unfortunately that is not the case.</p>
<p>The good news is that Wordpress has not only fixed the vulnerabilities, but also made the CMS generally more robust. So if you are non-technical and have your own Wordpress site, you may feel safer.</p>
<p>Yet, it is still highly recommended to leave the maintenance of your Wordpress site to someone who knows what they do - so that you can focus on the sites content.</p>

The password is often very complicated, so on the face of it there should be no need to change it. After all, who would guess a 20 character password that is a random of letters, digits and punctuation?</p>
<p>Unfortunately the problem is not whether the password is complicated. The issue is that a lot of vendors set the same password on all of the devices they send out. That means that if you know the password for your device or service, you can use it to get access to someone else who has the same device or service.</p>
<p>Luckily, more and more vendors and service providers now create a different password every time a device is sent out or a new account is created. In fact, often you have to set your own password the first time you access the device or service.</p>
<p>The practice of changing the password yourself is something that should always be done - whether the device or your service provider ask for it or not. It is the only way to ensure that nobody knows your password - and of course make sure your password is complex.</p>

The first time someone opened the Excel file, which contained special code to record location information each time it was accessed, was within a few days of having been uploaded.</p>
<p>It may come as no surprise that the file was mainly opened by users in Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil, with the most activity coming from Nigeria and Russia. On the other hand, the fact that the fake details were cross-checked and compared with other stolen data is new. One set of the fake credit card details was used to make a purchase, clearly in an attempt to test if the information was valid or not.</p>

Cirque du Soleil re-invented the concept of a "Circus" by providing its customers with more of what they really wanted - the element of performance and excitement, coupled with an air of exclusivity - which allowed it to access a new and higher spending audience base.</p>
<p>Cirque removed costly performers, who in the classic circus environment were stars in their own right, and with their own brand. These were replaced with performers who were part of a group and who were interchangeable, hugely increasing the flexibility of the business and ability to roll out the same experience in different locations, by hiring and training performers locally, thus saving on the cost of moving people and equipment.</p>
<p>They also removed costly animals, which create huge overheads in respect to animal welfare. The element of excitement that animals traditionally provided was replaced with daring performances and elaborate choreography.</p>
<p>Cirque du Soleil seems like a unique business, but all businesses can learn from their example. The principle idea is that the business no longer competes in a like-for-like comparison with its peers, but instead stands out by introducing unique selling points, that other businesses cannot reproduce or that is hard to quantify. Making a business unique and its services special, is always a good thing. If this can be coupled with a way of reducing costs, a business can leap ahead of its competitors and hugely increase its customer base.</p>

<p>Fist of all you have to acknowledge that you have a password problem. Many people have stupid passwords. Survey after survey proves that over half of passwords in use can be hacked within a few minutes.</p>
<p>The top 25 most common passwords from 2014 are:</p>
<ol><li>123456</li><li>password</li><li>12345</li><li>12345678</li><li>qwerty</li><li>123456789</li><li>1234</li><li>baseball</li><li>dragon</li><li>football</li><li>1234567</li><li>monkey</li><li>letmein</li><li>abc123</li><li>111111</li><li>mustang</li><li>access</li><li>shadow</li><li>master</li><li>michael</li><li>superman</li><li>696969</li><li>123123</li><li>batman</li><li>trustno1</li></ol>
<p>(Source: Gizmodo - <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2014-were-all-doomed-1680596951">http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2014-were-all-doomed-1680596951</a>)</p>
<p>Is your password in the list? No? That\'s a good start, but you\'re not in the clear just yet. Even if your password isn\'t on the list, chances are it can still be hacked within a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>So, a good approach is to use a password manager to create new codes. Really good, secure passwords use long sequences of characters, numbers and special characters. There are many solutions out there, from LastPass to Dashlane to 1Password to KeePass, and they all allow you to generate good, complex passwords. They also allow you to manage these passwords securely and reduce the burden of having to type them in manually, or having to copy and paste them, by providing plug-ins for most of the popular browsers and other software so usernames and passwords are automatically completed for you.</p>
<p>However, even with a really long, complex password, it is still recommended that you have a different password for each of your online accounts. Again, the password managers mentioned above help here.</p>
<p>So there is really no excuse for simple, easy-to-guess, stupid passwords.</p>

    'article' => '<p>Most businesses use a web development company to host and maintain their site for them. In many cases that is a good solution, as the business can give the headache of running a website to a third-party. However, bringing the hosting of a website in-house gives the business greater control and there are now so many mature solutions available that don\'t require a full-time web developer on the payroll.</p>
<p>The solutions are called CMS - content management systems. They provide a simple way for non-web savvy staff to create professional looking pages. Staff only need to concentrate on producing great content - the CMS does the rest. The content\'s look is decided by a website template that usually can be customized to fit the business\'s brand and changing to a different template doesn\'t require the whole website to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Many CMS are free, or open-source, but they are actively maintained, usually by a large community of developers who work on the CMS in their spare time. That means that if a bug is found in whatever CMS you choose, there will soon be a new version available that fixes the problem - and new versions also usually offer a slew of new functionality. So free isn\'t necessarily a negative, and a lot of businesses have jumped on the open-source bandwagon for a number of core business systems.</p>
<p>There are also a number of hosting solutions available for any of these CMS, so if web hosting is an issue for the business, a third-party supplier can easily be found.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at three of the most widely-used CMS - Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla. No solution will ever answer all business requirements, so it depends on the business goals as to what solution is the right one.</p>
<p>For a simple brochure-type site Wordpress is the best choice and it was really the first widely used open-source CMS. It is very easy to install and configure, and very easy to use. There is a huge number of plug-ins and templates available, so chances are that it will meet most business requirements.</p>
<p>Drupal on the other hand is a little harder to install and configure, and even though there is a large number of plug-ins and templates available to customize the website, Drupal\'s strength is that with some development knowledge it can be extended to do exactly what the business wants. However, that does mean the business needs to either find a developer to work in-house or to go to an external web development company for help.</p>
<p>Joomla is the middle ground between Wordpress and Drupal. It does offer a fair bit of customization by a developer, but it already does a great deal out of the box, is easily to install and configure, and there is a large number of plug-ins and templates available to make the website fit the business brand and requirements.</p>
<p>Below is a chart offering a detailed view of the pros and cons of the three solutions.</p>
