			<h1>My CV</h1>

			<aside>
				<p>I relish exploring new technologies and learning new skills, applying them to business processes to improve efficiency, increase productivity and develop new business opportunities.</p>
				<p>During my long career in IT, I have supported multiple offices in different time zones, with several dozen staff, including home workers. I have also administered, maintained and consolidated multiple, business critical servers.</p>
				<p>I have appointed and supervised external service providers and implemented and integrated a large number of projects of varying size and complexity.</p>
				<p>I have many years' experience in software development and website programming and I continue to work closely with developers, but my focus has now shifted to server infrastructure support.</p>

				<h2>PLASA</h2>
				<p class="dates">July 1999 - June 2014 (14 years 11 months)</p>
				<p class="team">IT Manager</p>
				<p>I managed a member of staff to fulfill all internal design, print production and web development requirements. I also managed two IT support companies to maintain and look after our internal IT infrastructure.</p>
				<p>I controlled a budget of over &pound;150,000 and dealt with all software and web development projects. I oversaw the IT infrastructure of three offices in two time zones, supporting over 50 staff and freelancers, including software, hardware, networking, site-to-site connections, operating systems, cloud services, etc.</p>
				<p>Over the years I completely overhauled the company's single website and extended it into five sites, creating a new advertising revenue stream of over &pound;20,000 annually.</p>
				<p>I programmed the sites in JScript (ASP) and PHP, and designed them to be device agnostic and search engine optimized. I implemented load performance improvements, such as lazy image loading and late script loading. I developed a number of different caching techniques to reduce the load on the server and recently implemented CDN on some sites to increase performance even further. I used JQuery for cross-platform compatibility and rapid development, and applied strict CSS and HTML separation for easy site maintenance.</p>
				<p>I also designed and implemented a number of SQL databases, as well as some internal MS Access databases and other simple systems to allow non-technical staff to update our websites and make staff more efficient and productive.</p>
				<p>I regularly use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, Acrobat, as well as Microsoft Access, Excel, Word and Outlook. I have migrated the company's Exchange infrastructure to Office 365 and set up Amazon EC2 for additional, shared data storage. I use GitHub for code maintenance and a combination of Confluence, Gliffy, Excel and Access to document our systems.</p>
